## Crafting recipe

Some recipes are used to avoid mistakes that break the game (and lead to arguments)

* bucket + obsidian = lava bucket
* 8x bone meal + dirt block (in the middle) = grass block
* 8x bone meal + netherrack (in the middle) = crimson nylium

## Others

* KeepInventory will be off
* Player falling into void, surviving void damage once (2 hearts) will teleport back to the last standing location after health < 2.5 hearts.
* Items dropped to void due to death will teleport to Y=255 and fall down infinitely until despawn.
